# Natural-Language-Processing-Yelp-Reviews
We will be attempting to classify Yelp Reviews into 1 star or 5 star categories based off the text content in the reviews. Each 
observation in this dataset is a review of a particular business by a particular user. We will use Natural Language Processing on the text 
within the review to see if we can predict 1 star and 5 star reviews.
